<b>Speaker 1:</b> Today is October 24 2005. My name is Nnnnn Nnnn and I'm with the Massanutten Regional Library in Nnnnnnnnnn, Nnnnnn. Today we're with Nnnn Nnnnnnn Nnnnnn Nnnnn. She was born here in Nnnnnnnnnn and on April the 2nd 1912. (To [00:00:30] Nnnn) So you've been a native of Nnnnnnnnnn all of your life?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> A native...?
<b>Speaker 1:</b> of Nnnnnnnnnn?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Yes I have
<b>Speaker 1:</b> You were born and raised here?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Yeah.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Right here on Gay Street or?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> No, I was born on Nnnnnn Street. As I became nine years old, my daddy, moved us down to the corner of Broad & Gay, in one of the houses that he'd built [00:01:00] for the family. It's a big white house, that is facing Broad, but the side is on Gay Street on the corner of those two streets.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> What was it like growing up in Nnnnnnnnnn? What was Nnnnnnnnnn like while you were growing up?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Oh a very pleasant place to live. [Clears throat] We enjoyed it very much. We grew up... [00:01:30] I had one sister, and two brothers. And I was oldest of all of the four. And my sister's next to me, her name was Nnnn and next is my brother Nnnnnn, the picture so a while ago, and the baby was Nnnn. Nnnn Nnnnnnn. His picture's over somewhere around here.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Where did you go to [00:02:00] school at?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Oh, at first, I went after finishing Nnnnnn(?) high school. I didn't go to Nnnnn. Because Nnnnnn was the first school. And I went to [unintelligible/unintelligible ends] I graduated with my high school graduation diploma from Nnnnnn Street school. And from there...
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Now that school is not here
<b>Speaker 2:</b> No, anymore, is it? [00:02:30] that's where you see Roses. [unintelligible] Down in there is where it was in through there. [unintelligible ends]
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Now what about elementary school? Where was that?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> That was the same place. The elementary school was in the lower floor, and the upper floor was the high school. So I was there a long time [laughs] everything in one place.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> How many students were there in the school?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> There weren't too many at that time though [unintelligible] they will [00:03:00] need to [unintelligible ends] because by having an elementary school in the bottom of the high school that made quite a few, but they only had [unintelligible] Nnnnnnnnnn here they [unintelligible ends] only Nnnnnnnnnn students when I was in school. And...
<b>Speaker 1:</b> What was your favorite subject? [Nnnn says "huh?] What was your favorite subject?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Well, I liked history [00:03:30] and especially English; I liked English grammar and English literature, both and I liked the simple science. I didn't like chemistry too well. I wasn't too much in love with algebra. But I liked other math and not the higher though you know and Latin the [00:04:00] professors taught Latin, I have three years of Latin.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> That's great.
<b>Speaker 2:</b> You ever have Latin?
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Yes ma'am. [Overlapping dialogue from the two before Nnnnnn resumes] Yes ma'am [laughs]
<b>Speaker 2:</b> And people said "Well you should've had something else." But I'd say to them that a lot of our English words came from Latin language.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Exactly. (Nnnn)
<b>Speaker 2:</b> And you can speak it and you can give, for an example, water was [00:04:30] aqua and we have aquamarine...
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Aquatic...
<b>Speaker 2:</b> We have aqueducts and all those things mean water [unintelligible] that may lead nowhere after that [unintelligible ends].
<b>Speaker 1:</b> [laughs] So how was being a teenager here in Nnnnnnnnnn? What did you do for
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Oh, [unintelligible] fun? precious it was [unintelligible ends] it wasn't too much fun you did [00:05:00] You came to school [unintelligible] job for pain free to do what you got oh [unintelligible ends] my mother had something for your arm [unintelligible] is one of those veterans if you knew or a friend or is [unintelligible ends]
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Yes ma'am I know, the cast iron ones that you heated up.
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Heat on the stove, [Nnnnnn says "Yep"] and then take a potholder and by the time you got to where you were earning you had to go back and get another iron [unintelligible] division [unintelligible ends] pants. I had to press and do my sisters and brothers things and [00:05:30] my Daddy's shirt or whatever or if the steps need dusting, something was always home to do.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Now living here in Nnnnnnnnnn you had running water and...
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Well now on every street we have stickers(?) out in the yard and I would do a toilet to dead tired Nnnnnnnnnn doesn't allow toilets right there now but even when we came to Broad Street to live they still had outdoor [00:06:00] toilets and then [unintelligible] below King I guess I don't know with [unintelligible ends] my father built one of those averaging coins on our back porch with a door and they have a good tool you just pushed on it and everything went down [unintelligible] is that my door this day is a new dog it was straight out we have a name for what I can't think of the name right [00:06:30] now. 
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Hmm. Well what year was that? Do you remember?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> [lengthy pause as she considers the question] Oh, let me see it must have been somewhere in the 20's
<b>Speaker 1:</b> In the 20's? And that was when the town did (the two start speaking simultaneously, difficult to discern what each is saying) that then was
<b>Speaker 2:</b> (Nnnn resumes talking on her own) a spigot out in the yard.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> When did you get running water?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> We got running water [unintelligible] we so [unintelligible ends] [00:07:00] running water? It might be getting close to the 30's maybe.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> 30's?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Because we had water in the kitchen then, with Mom & Dad(?) you know.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> And what about electricity?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Well let's see when did we get that? Because I know we use it lanterned chimneys(?) to see because I know my little sister was sitting [unintelligible][unintelligible ends] [00:07:30] next to the old [unintelligible][unintelligible ends] park [unintelligible]that going in[unintelligible ends] and one chimney broke a piece of glass onto her face [unintelligible]my hair she worked out attractively you know a good [unintelligible ends] place or and that must have been [unintelligible] I see me all [unintelligible ends] must have been around the [00:08:00] 1990s something like that maybe it must've been around that time.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Were there a lot of cars here in Nnnnnnnnnn?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Oh no, not a whole lot. A few people had some of those, what you call reels(?) now I think and they will just [unintelligible] eat and you know, and it's amazing. I will be having members [unintelligible ends] open cars or lay-back lid you know, and [00:08:30] there were spor-sport cars that the young people had, you know, a few of the younger people [unintelligible]with ties to the street then [unintelligible ends] you didn't get to go out with boys like they do now, 'cause my daddy would greet him at the door [unintelligible] inviting him talking [unintelligible ends] and ask him, he said "What is your" umm... what was his, his main words? [00:09:00] Umm... let's see here, let's get it straight.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> [laughs]
<b>Speaker 2:</b> [laughs] "First, what you wanna see my daughter for?"
<b>Speaker 1:</b> [laughs]
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Yeah he was real strict(?) about his girls, he didn't want anybody to mess his girls up.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Now how did you get around to places? Did everybody just walk or did you have horses?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Most of the time you walked.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> You walked? So you walked to school?
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Yeah I walked to school, even after I started teaching at Nnnnn I [00:09:30] walked to school. We haven't always had buses, no we haven't, not in the city we didn't have buses. Because then they started coming from other places like some came from Grottoes and some came from the [unintelligible] NGO(?) Nnnnnn tampers children's deal [unintelligible ends],
<b>Speaker 1:</b> And that's because the schools were segregated back then
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Entirely right? [00:10:00] segregated schools. Oh they were segregated up until I left Nnnnn as a teacher; up till 1966 that's when I went to [unintelligible]work(?) to save even though we have to deal [unintelligible ends] Nnnnn, and Nnnnnnnnn too in Staunton [unintelligible] and all the sudden when [00:10:30] you[unintelligible ends] I finished school- uh, high school in 1930 and my grades were high you know and I loved school just loved it. And I tell you who was the teacher who told us to sing. Nnnnn-Nnnnnn Nnnnn(?) [unintelligible] to the nurse in most places [unintelligible] named after. [00:11:00] But she- her name at that time was Morgan and she married a man named Revan Nnnnn(?), that's where the Nnnnn came from, but she was a Nnnnnnn graduate. Miss Nnnn Nnnn was a Nnnnnnn graduate. And those women were very knowledgeable. And this(?) [00:11:30] came from... I think he went to... it seemed like he went to Nnnnnn, but I want to make no mistake(?). He was very proper. He taught the- he taught the Latin, and the history, and civics. And you know he was still principal when I went to Nnnn but just for a short time because he [00:12:00] was principal when I went to school as a little girl six years old. And when I came to teach at the end(?) he always called [unintelligible] him to reframe [unintelligible ends] he could never accept the fact that I was going to teach beside him(?)
<b>Speaker 1:</b> [laughs]
<b>Speaker 2:</b> And so one day he brought me a civics paper that he kept through the years - it had my grade, [00:12:30] an A. 
<b>Speaker 2:</b> I
<b>Speaker 1:</b> [laughs] like civics, but they don't teach civics anymore.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> They do they just teach-
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Do they?
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Eighth grade I think, instead of in high school now they teach in eighth grade.
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Oh they do? I thought they'd stopped teaching it I hadn't heard anybody say- [coughs] oh I'm sorry, I can't talk good today.
<b>Speaker 1:</b> My son had civics when he was in the eighth grade.
<b>Speaker 2:</b> Can you understand?
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Oh yes ma'am. [00:13:00] So when you graduated from high school in 1930 and you wanted to go to college...
<b>Speaker 2:</b> [unintelligible] women rejoice [unintelligible ends] went to college. Down in New Nnnnnn, near Nnnnn Nnnnnnn, there was no school for black children and people in Nnnnn Nnnnnnn places began [unintelligible] reasonable Okay, you [unintelligible ends] 'cause there was high school[unintelligible/unintelligible ends]. [00:13:30] And they had an old school building there that they used some years way back. And then of course need from the house [unintelligible] daddy's house. May [unintelligible ends] school rooms I've ever it had a downstairs to it. So, the superintendent, down in Nnnnnnnn became worried because the people were so upset. So he called Mr. [00:14:00] Nnnnn Are you from here(?)?
<b>Speaker 1:</b> Nnnnn Elementary? The one that...
<b>Speaker 2:</b> [unintelligible]why [unintelligible ends] He said "Mr. Nnnnn, do you have anybody that'll come down here and teach these people's children?" Well, my daddy worked with schools and went down because carpenters didn't have much to do in the winter. Because houses like this were built the- they had plastered [00:14:30] walls and those walls had to dry and they couldn't dry in cold weather, and they didn't have- [coughs] a couple of the apparatuses they have now. And then they come in on trucks that day they'd have to meet and they'd saw the old wood and measure it, and everything and he and his brother of course were carpenters in Nnnnnnnnnn boys. Well [00:15:00] he says, Daddy, he said "Joey said Nnnn would go down and work with those children she's such a stable girl and everything." [unintelligible] there's [unintelligible ends] no he said "I'll talk to her mother about it." So they talked to go over it and they said if I wanted to try I could, they didn't want to tell him no or something. [unintelligible] [00:15:30] So after I made that little Cabeus so it means that the doctors that [unintelligible ends] [coughs] See I would've been 18 years old. [unintelligible] We see a will he'll take Marian down my car [unintelligible ends] and take it down to Nnnnnnnn and see this main but first I went by to see the school. [00:16:00] Well, windows all broken up, [unintelligible] foolish to have their [unintelligle ends], blackboard hanging off the wall all ragged. I said "Hmm, I don't think I want to be down here coal(?) house all broken up [unintelligible] toy for down [unintelligible ends]. So [clears throat] so when I went to see him I told him I said "I was told that you were the one to [00:16:30] teach the black children." Well I said this place up here that you have I said "There'll be no way I could go in there." I told what all was wrong with everything and then they had a great peek at it. [unintelligible] The things Yeah, boy when every roll there is a clean nap [unintelligible ends]. And I said the stove's no good for winter [00:17:00] then he said "Young lady," he said, "If you will come I'll get this thing fixed up for you, by November, and I'll write and tell you will Yeah, wait ram I would just do a little jobs here in there at station(?) high school. [clears throat] One day the letter came and said the school was ready. Well, then we went back down to [00:17:30] see. New blackboard all the way across the room, new floors, new stove.
